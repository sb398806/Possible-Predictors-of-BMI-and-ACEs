# Possible-Predictors-of-BMI-and-ACEs
First data science project for Statistical Methods II. This project required analyzing, presenting, and discussing a linear regression model and a logistic regresion model to describe a publicly available data set. I used the 2021 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data set to explore possible predictors of BMI &amp; Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in adults, ages 18-79, living in one of five southern US states. I built and compared two linear regression models to predict BMI. I built and compared two logisitic regression models to predict exposure to ACEs.
