# Possible-Predictors-of-BMI-and-ACEs
First data science project for Statistical Methods II. I used the 2021 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data set to explore possible predictors of BMI &amp; Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in adults, ages 18-79, living in one of five southern US states. For this project, I built, analyzed, presented, and discussed a linear regression model to predict BMI and a logistic regresion model to predict exposure to ACEs.
